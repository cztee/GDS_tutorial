# Perceptron with Tiny MAC
This project implements a perceptron that computes y = sign(3*x0 - 2*x1 + 1), where x0 and x1 are 4-bit signed inputs, which is ui_in[7:0]. The output is uo_out[7:0], and when the output is greater than 0, uo_out[0] is 1; otherwise, it is 0. It is given the name y_reg. The values will be saved to sum_reg which is uo_out[7:1]
The design uses a sequential 4x4-bit MAC, which implements a simple FSM concept.

## How it works
- Inputs are x0 (ui_in[3:0]) and x1 (ui_in[7:4]), which are multiplied by weights (3 and -2) and summed with a bias (1). Note that the weights are hard-coded, unlike a real "tunable" NN. 
- The result is passed through a sign function to produce y_reg.
- The MAC operates in three cycles when ena=1, controlled by a finite state machine.

## How to test
- Set ena=1 (ENA pin) --> It is automatically set to 1 when powering the chip
- Apply a reset pulse (RST_N=0 then 1). --> which we are unable to do as we don't have access to those control ports; it should be automatically set to 1.
- Set ui_in[7:0] using DIP switches (e.g., x0=1, x1=1 as 8'b00010001).
- Observe uo_out[0] (y_reg) for the result (1 if sum â‰¥ 0, else 0).
- Monitor uo_out[7:1] for the upper sum bits.
