# Perceptron with Tiny MAC
This project implements a perceptron computing y = sign(3*x0 - 2*x1 + 1), where x0 and x1 are 4-bit signed inputs from ui_in[7:0]. The output y_reg is on uo_out[0], and sum_reg[7:1] is on uo_out[7:1]. The design uses a sequential 4x4-bit MAC.

## How it works
- Inputs x0 (ui_in[3:0]) and x1 (ui_in[7:4]) are multiplied by weights (3 and -2) and summed with a bias (1).
- The result is passed through a sign function to produce y_reg.
- The MAC operates in three cycles when ena=1, controlled by a finite state machine.

## How to test
- Set ena=1 (ENA pin).
- Apply a reset pulse (RST_N=0 then 1).
- Set ui_in[7:0] using DIP switches (e.g., x0=1, x1=1 as 8'b00010001).
- Observe uo_out[0] (y_reg) for the result (1 if sum â‰¥ 0, else 0).
- Monitor uo_out[7:1] for the upper sum bits.
